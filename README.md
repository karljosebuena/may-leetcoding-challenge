# May Leetcoding Challenge

## Attention
Please note that these are just my solutions, these are not the most optimized solutions for these problems.
Please bear in mind that I created this repo for coding practice and educationl purposes only.
And because I was inspired by Akshay Saini (akshaymarch7), and followed his tips
on how to go about to benefit the most in these leetcode monthly challenges.

## Additional Info
Runtime execution of these solutions is different when you run them locally and when you submit it in leetcode.
Even in leetcode, resubmission of the same solution changes the runtime result, factors such as net speed
and server connectivity are variables to this change.
